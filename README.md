# whitepaper-blocks
DEPRECATED - A set of custom blocks for the Gutenberg editor to be used with ACF

IMPORTANT NOTE: These blocks were originally built using the ACF plugin. At the time, ACF blocks were in beta, and it had been indicated that they would be available in the free version of ACF once it was out of beta. That did not come to pass. Having commited to never forcing WhitePaper users into paid software, I have decided to discontinue devlopment on these blocks. If you are using these in conjunction with the Pro version of ACF, they should still work just fine. I will be working on a replacement plugin with traditionally-coded blocks soon. However, it will not be backwards compatibile with this set.
